- Check to make sure MongoDB is open on the default port (27017)
- Make sure the dependencies for this project had been installed
- Check the terminal for the login information after the collections setup
- Change directory to the FarazSiddiqui-FinalProject folder and type "node server.js" in the same terminal
- When running server.js for the first time, the file will create a new collection called finalProject, which will
contain an admin login in the format {"email": root@admin.com, "password": ryerson123}. If this collection is 
already made, it will skip the collection creation part of the code and you will have to use the existing login 
information that will be compatible with the email and password format of the code. If the indexes are not in 
the correct format, then the collection must be deleted and then generated by server.js.
- The server.js file will automatically open the localhost server url in a browser (to the login page). 
  If a new tab to the server is not open, enter the address http://localhost:3000/ to access the login page
